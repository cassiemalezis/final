      <p>"Calling all matcha lovers! This is our creamiest, sweetest, most delicate matcha yet. Hailing from the world-renowned tea gardens in Nishio, Japan, it was made only the finest, most tender leaves possible – from the most flavourful harvest of the year. And before it was painstakingly stone ground, even the tiniest leaf veins were removed. The result? A bright emerald, smooth-drinking matcha fit for an emperor."</p>
